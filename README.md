# Snakes and Ladders with Python

Code for a presentation by [James Campbell](https://github.com/theref) for [Django Weekend Cardiff](https://djangoweekend.org/).

All the code was written in Python using [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/). The pdf's were then created using [LaTex](http://www.latex-project.org/). For those who are unable to build .tex files, the final pdf's are included in the release.
