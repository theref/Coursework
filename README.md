# Snakes and Ladders with Python

This repository contains code written by [James Campbell](http://www.jamescampbell.org.uk/) for the mathematical analysis of the game ‘Snakes and Ladders’ and also the presentation of that analysis at the [Django Weekend Cardiff](https://djangoweekend.org/).

The analysis code (in the file 'pythons and ladders.sagews’) is written in Python using the [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) mathematical package. 

The remaining files (.tex and .bib) use the [LaTex](http://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting package to define two output documents: ‘Presentation.pdf’ (the material presented at Django Weekend Cardiff) and ‘SALCoursework.pdf’ (coursework produced for my computing module)

For those unable to build the .tex files, both pdf’s are included in the release (which you can find in the menu above).
